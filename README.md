# Information-Retrieval-lab
The Information Retrieval Lab conducts research in the areas of information retrieval (e.g. search engines) and information extraction.

### Web Crawling
Web crawling is a process of graph exploration and collecting data. Information which was gathered may be used then to:
* build a search engine (Google, etc.),
* analyse users behaviour (e.g., which pages are visited frequently, how users move
through the web?),
* business intelligence (what are the current actions of my opponents or partners?),
* collecting e-mail addresses (phishing, sending spam).
