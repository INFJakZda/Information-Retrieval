# Information-Retrieval-lab
The Information Retrieval Lab conducts research in the areas of information retrieval (e.g. search engines) and information extraction.

## Web Crawling
Web crawling is a process of graph exploration and collecting data. Information which was gathered may be used then to:
* build a search engine (Google, etc.),
* analyse users behaviour (e.g., which pages are visited frequently, how users move
through the web?),
* business intelligence (what are the current actions of my opponents or partners?),
* collecting e-mail addresses (phishing, sending spam).

## Apache Tika
Toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as DOC, PPT, XLS and PDF; http://tika.apache.org):
* Apache Tika provides methods for automatic file type detection.
* Tika provides support for the most popular metadata formats and tools for defining own
ones

## Apache Open NLP
Open source Java library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It supports the most common NLP tasks such as:
* tokenization,
* sentence segmentation,
* part-of-speech tagging,
* named entity extraction,
* chunking,
* parsing,
* language detection,
* coreference resolution,
